# Supply-Chain-Analysis-
"To analyze key supply chain metrics across products, suppliers, shipping, and transportation to improve efficiency and cost-effectiveness."

## Problem Statement
The supply chain dataset presents a comprehensive set of information related to product sales, 
manufacturing, and logistics. The challenge is to extract meaningful insights and actionable recommendations from the data to 
optimize supply chain operations and improve profitability.

## Tools used

- python libraries (numpy, pandas, matplotlib and seaborn)

- Excel

- Power Bi


## Python Analysis:- 

### Table of Contents:

- Load Dataset

- Import Libraries

- Exploratory Data Analysis

- Checking Null Values and Cleaning Data

- Visualization :


## Sales Analysis:

- Analyze the number of products sold and revenue generated to understand sales performance over time.

- Identify customer demographics to determine which groups are purchasing the most products.

- Track availability and stock levels to ensure the right products are in stock when customers are ready to buy.


## Operational Analysis:

- Analyze lead times, order quantities, and production volumes to optimize inventory management and reduce stockouts.

- Track manufacturing lead times and costs to identify areas for improvement and cost savings.

- Monitor inspection results and defect rates to identify quality issues and improve manufacturing processes.


## Shipping Analysis:

- Analyze costs, transportation modes, and routes to optimize logistics and reduce shipping costs.

- Monitor shipping times, shipping carriers, and modes of transportation to ensure timely delivery to customers.

- Track shipping costs associated with shipping carriers and revenue generated to identify areas for cost savings.


## Libraries Used for the Analysis:

Data Manipulation: NumPy, Pandas

Data Visualization: Seaborn, Matplotlib


## Dataset used
[supply_chain_data](https://github.com/Praneeth2003-oss/Supply-Chain-Analysis-/blob/a76d21888c9cea2988415d20e20ee494bb285a65/supply_chain_data)


## Power BI:
In Power Bi, build charts, graphs, and KPIs to visualize the data and understand it more interactively, along with 
that, build some slicers to make it more user-friendly to customize the charts and graphs.

Visualizing Key Insights

From the overall analysis, I have discovered some key insights:

- Skincare products are the most profitable, generating significant revenue. Haircare products come next in popularity, followed by cosmetics.

- Carrier C has the highest shipping costs on average, with carrier A as the second-costliest option. Carrier B, on the other hand, is the most affordable choice.

- Among the four transportation modes (air, rail, road, and sea), air transportation is associated with higher shipping costs, while sea transportation offers a more economical solution.

Key Performance Indicators (KPIs):

- Total Revenue: 577,000

- Average Product Price: 49.46

- Total Products Sold: 46,000

- Manufacturing Cost: 47.27

- Total Available Products: 4,840

- Total Stock Value: 4,777


## Charts and Graphs:

- Average Defect Rate, Manufacturing Lead Time, and Manufacturing Cost by Product

- Customer Demographics vs. Number of Products Sold by Product Type

- Total Revenue Generated by Product Type and Total Products Sold by Product Type

- Average Manufacturing Cost vs. Average Price by Product Type

- Transportation Modes vs. Routes with Average Cost

- Defect Rate vs. Inspection Rate by Product Type

- Transportation Modes and Shipping Carriers with Average Shipping Time


## Interactive Slicers:

- Product Type

- Transportation Mode

- Shipping Carrier

- Routes


## Business Impact:

By identifying high-performing products, improving transportation methods, and understanding customer demographics, this analysis can directly support:

- Inventory planning

- Supplier and route optimization

- Targeted marketing strategies

- Cost reduction in logistics


## Conclusion

This supply chain analysis offered important insights into

- operational

- manufacturing

- distribution aspects of the business.

By conducting thorough data analysis and creating visualizations, we discovered several key patterns and performance metrics.
